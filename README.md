##Reason for submit assignment delay
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to extend my sincere apologies for the delayed submission of my assignment. Unfortunately, I encountered an unexpected issue related to the Firebase version compatibility with Angular, which regrettably led to the delay in submitting my work.

I was not aware of the specific Firebase version that is compatible with Angular, and this lack of knowledge caused the assignment submission to be postponed. I took some extra time to research and resolve the compatibility issue to ensure the assignment is submitted correctly.

I understand that this delay may have caused inconvenience, and for that, I sincerely apologize. I assure you that I take my academic responsibilities seriously and will make every effort to prevent such delays in the future.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.

Best regards,

Sushama Motekar
